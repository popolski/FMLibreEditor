//! A player's loan: the second contract a player on loan has, with the team he is on loan to.
//!
//! The game keeps it apart from his contract with his own club (see [`LoanLayout`]). The editor reads where he is on
//! loan, from when to when and on what terms, and changes the day the loan ends (the field `loan.expires`, see
//! [`crate::fields`]). It
//! never ends a loan itself. The game takes that day as the loan's last one: when it is over, the game ends the loan
//! and the player is back at his club the next day, as at the end of any loan. So a loan brought forward to end on the
//! game's date brings him back one day on (on the Game Pass save, Onana and Bayındır, made to end the next day, were
//! back two days on).
