//! Finding the game's own variables in a build the editor has no profile for.
//!
//! Each build of the game moves its static data. A build profile ([`BuildProfile`]) places the entity arrays, the
//! in-game date and the static pointer to the retirement manager for each build the editor was checked with. For any
//! other build, or where a place a profile names does not check out, the editor looks for them:
//! - the entity arrays, by scanning the game plugin ([`crate::calibrate`]);
//! - the in-game date, among the values in the plugin's writable data that read as dates: the one the game's own data
//!   agrees with, which [`crate::health`] works out from contracts and injuries;
//! - the retirement manager's static, as far from the players' array as another build keeps it, or else by searching
//!   the plugin's writable data for a pointer to the one object of its class (see [`crate::rtti`]).
//!
//! Only reads memory.
